// LC 860: Lemonade Change
// At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
// Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
// Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
// EXAMPLE:
// Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
// Output: true
// Explanation: 
// From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
// From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
// From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
// Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

// LC 455: Assign Cookies
// Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
// Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
// EXAMPLE:
// Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
// And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
// You need to output 1.

// LC 55: Jump Game
// You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
// Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
// EXAMPLE:
// Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
// Output: true
// Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index
