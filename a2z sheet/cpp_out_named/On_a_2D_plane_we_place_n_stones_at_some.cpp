 * QUESTION:
 *
 * On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
 *
 * A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
 *
 * Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
 * 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
 * 2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
 * 3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
 * 4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
 * 5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
 * Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
